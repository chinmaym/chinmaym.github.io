      <description>Leetcode 1 [Link to the question] (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ &amp;ldquo;2 Sum&amp;rdquo;)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order. Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].</description>

      <description>Leetcode 1403 [Link to the question] (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order/ &amp;ldquo;Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order&amp;rdquo;)
Given the array nums, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence. If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.</description>

Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the array equal to its value. Return a lucky integer in the array. If there are multiple lucky integers return the largest of them. If there is no lucky integer return -1. Example 1: Input: arr = [2,2,3,4] Output: 2 Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.</description>

      <description>Leetcode 771 [Link to the question] (https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/ &amp;ldquo;Jewels and Stones&amp;rdquo;)
You&amp;#39;re given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; is considered a different type of stone from &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;.</description>

      <description>[Link to the question] (https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/ &amp;ldquo;Sqrt&amp;rdquo;)
Implement int sqrt(int x). Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned. Example 1: Input: 4 Output: 2 Example 2: Input: 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.</description>

      <description>Leetcode 665 [Link to the question] (https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/ &amp;ldquo;Non-decreasing Array&amp;rdquo;)
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element. We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] &amp;lt;= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt;= n - 2). Example 1: Input: nums = [4,2,3] Output: true Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.</description>

      <description>This is the start of my Leetcode challenge. I have recently been inspired to solve all the leetcode problems. I usually have these kind of latent interests of mine awakened by some some video that i saw on youtube or some blog that i read. I will try to solve as many questions as i can, I will be trying to solve atleast one a day.
I will start with easy ones and then transition into the medium and hard level questions.</description>
